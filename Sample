The team converted DML files into ICD format and presented a demo to the client.


2. Based on client feedback, files were adjusted to match the standard ICD format.


3. Automated Java code validated the standard format, confirming consistency.


4. Around 360 ICD files were generated and tested for the MENA cluster in the EMEA region.


5. The team is working with the TEM and production teams to retrieve the remaining DML and DAT files for the MENA and SSA clusters.
