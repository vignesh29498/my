The team connected with the FlexBus Ab Initio team to gain knowledge about various types of flows.

They requested DML files for 10 service IDs and received 6 files for 3 of those services.

The team successfully converted the DML files into ICD format for four columns.

They are also coordinating with the Flex team to differentiate between good and bad DML files using a UNIX script.

GEN AI:

The team engaged with the Gen AI team for support on generating a high volume of outputs.

The Gen AI team provided inputs for reviewing the structure of the LLaMA message format and shared ideas for rewriting. T



he team is currently working on implementing these changes.




As discussed, I'm sharing the handoff files for your analysis. Please validate these files and share your observations against the DML files.
